    title: FRITZ! Smart Home REST API
    description: |-
        This is the specification for the FRITZ! Smart Home REST API for FRITZ!OS 8.20.

        All FRITZ!Smart Home and other compatible devices use the concept of units within the framework of the FRITZ!Smart Home REST-API.
        Most (physical) devices have at least one and up to n units. Each group has one unit. An Exception to this rule may be Zigbee-Repeaters.
        A unit provides the interface(s) for the operation of the device, e.g. switching a lightbulb on and off, changing its color or brightness level.
        Units may provide a unit type, which indicates certain to be expected interfaces and helps to classify the unit.

        The FRITZ!Box and FRITZ!Smart Gateway support the HAN FUN App Layer Protocol of the (DECT-)ULE Alliance.
        The FRITZ!Smart Gateway supports the Zigbee protocol with the Zigbee Cluster Library of the Connectivity Standards Alliance.
        For a list of supported Zigbee devices check https://fritz.com/service/zigbee/. Proprietary HAN-FUN and Zigbee Interfaces are not supported.
